Write a program that accepts as input a sentence in which all the words are runtogether,
but the first character of each word is uppercase. Convert the sentence to a string in which the words are separated by spaces and only the first word starts with an uppercase letter.
Fore example the string "StopAndSmellTheRoses." would be converted to "Stop and smell the roses."
