Write a program that asks the user to enter a series of single digit numbers with nothing separating them. The program should display the sum of all the single digit numbers in the
string. For example if the user enters 2514, the method should return 12, which is the sum of 2, 5, 1, and 4. The program should also display the highest and lowest digits in the string.
(Hint: convert the string to an array.)
