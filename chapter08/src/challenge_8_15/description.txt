Write a program that reads a sentence as input and converts each word to "Pig Latin".
In one version of Pig Latin you convert a word by removing the first letter,
placing that letter at the end of the word, and then appending "ay" to the word. Here is an example:

English :    I SLEPT MOST OF THE NIGHT
Pig Latin :  IAY LEPTSAYOSTMAY FOAY HETAY IGHTNAY
