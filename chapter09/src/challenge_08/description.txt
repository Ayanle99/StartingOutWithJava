A retail  store has a preferred customer plan where customers can earn discounts on all their purchases. The amount of a customer’s discount is determined by the amount of the customer’s cumulative purchases int he store, as follows:

	1) When a preferred customer spends $500, he or she gets a 5% discount on all future purchases.
	2) When a preferred customer spends $1,000, he or she gets a 6% discount on all future purchases.
 	3) When a preferred customer spends $1,500, he or she gets a 7% discount on all future purchases.
	4) When a preferred customer spends $2,000, or more, he or she gets a 10% discount on all future purchases.

	$500 => 5%
	$1,000 => 6%
	$1,500 => 7%
	$2,000 => 10%

Design a class named PreferredCustomer, which inherits from the Customer class you created in Programing Challenge 7,
The PreferredCustomer class should have fields for the amount of the customer’s purchases and the customer’s discount
level. Write one or more constructors and the appropriate mutator and accessor methods for the class’s fields.
Demonstrate the class in a simple program..
