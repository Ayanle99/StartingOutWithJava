In a course, a teacher gives the following tests and assignments:

  index: (0)  1) A lab activity that is observed by the teacher and assigned a numeric score.
  index: (1)  2) A pass/fail exam that has 10 questions. The minimum passing score is 70.
  index: (2)  3) An essay that is assigned a numeric score.
  index: (3)  4) A final exam that has 50 questions.

  (lab) => numeric value
  (essay) => numeric value

Write a class named CourseGrades. The class should have a GradedActivity array named grades as a field. The array should have four elements, one for each of the assignment previously described. The class should have the following methods:

setLab: This method should accept GradedActivity object as its argument. This object should already hold the student’s score for the lab activity. Element 0 of the grades field should reference this object.

setPassFailExam: This method should accept a PassFailExam object as its argument. This object should already hold the student’s score for the pass/fail exam. Element 1 of the grades field should reference this object.

setEssay: This method should accept asa Essay object as its argument. (See Programming challenge 4 for the Essay class. If you have not completed Programming Challenge 4, use a GradedActivity object instead.) This object should already hold the student’s  score for the essay. Element 2 of the grades field should reference this object.

setFinalExam: This method should accept a FinalExam object as its argument. This object should already hold the student’s  score for the final exam. Element 3 of the grades field should reference this objet.

toString: This method should return a string that contains the numeric scores and grades for each element in the grades array.

Demonstrate the class in a program.
