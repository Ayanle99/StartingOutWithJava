Design a class  named Employee. The class should keep the following information
in fields:

Employee name
Employee number in the format XXX-L, where each X is a digit within the range 0-9
and the L is a letter within the range A-M.
Hire date


Write one or more constructors and the appropriate accessor and mutator methods for the class.
Next, write a class named ProductionWorker that inherits from the Employee
class. The ProductionWorker class should have fields to hold the follwoing information:

Shift (an integer)
Hourly pay rate (a double)

The workday is divided into two shifts: day and night. The shift field will be an integer value
representing the shift that the employee works. The day shift is shift 1 and the night shift is
shift 2. Write one or more constructors and the appropriate accessorand mutator methods for the
class.

Demonstrate the class by writing a program that uses a ProductionWorker object.
