Modify the CourseGrades class you created in Programming Challenge 5 so it implements  the following interface:

 public interface Analyzable {

        double getAverage();
        GradedActivity getHighest();
        GradedActivity getLowest();


 }

 The getAverage method should return the average of the numeric scores stored in the grade array.
 The getHighest method should return a reference to the element of the grades array that has the
 highest numeric score. The getLowest method should return a reference to the element of the grades
 array that has the lowest numeric score. Demonstrate the new methods in a complete program.
