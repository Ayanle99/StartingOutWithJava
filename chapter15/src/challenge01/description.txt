Create a JavaFX application where the user enters the wholesale cost of an item and its markup percentage into TextFields. (For example, if an item’s wholesale cost is $5 its markup percentage is 100%, then its retail price is $10.) The application should have a button that displays the item’s retail price when clicked.
