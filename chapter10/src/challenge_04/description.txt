MonthClass

Write a class named Month. The class should have an int field named monthNumber that  holds the number of the month. For example,
January would be 1, February would be 2, and so forth. In addition, provide the following methods:

1) a no-arg constructor that sets the monthNumber field to 1.
2) A constructor that accepts the number of the month as an argument. It should set the monthNumber field to the value passed as the argument. If a value less than 1or greater than 12 is passed, the constructor should set monthNumber to 1.
3) A constructor that accepts the name of the month, such as “January” or “February”” , as a an argument. It should set the month number field to the correct corresponding value. A setMonthNumber method the accepts an int argument, which is assigned to the monthNumber field. If a value less than 1 or greater than12 is passed, the method should set monthnumber to 1.
4) A getMonthNumber method that returns the value in the monthNumber field.
5) A getMonthName method that returns the name of the month. For example, if the monthNumber field contains 1, then the number should return “January”.
6) A toString method that returns the same value as the getMonthName method.
7) An equals method that accepts a Month object as an argument. If the argument object  holds the same data as at the  calling object, the method should return true. Otherwise, it should return false.
8) A greaterThan method that accepts a Month object as an argument. If the calling object’s monthNumber field is greater than the arguments monthNumber field, this method should return true. Otherwise, it should return false.
9) A lessThan method that accepts a Month object as an argument. If the calling object’s monthNumber field is less than the arguments monthNumber field, this method should return true. Otherwise, it should return false.


MonthClassExceptions
Programming Challenge 5 of chapter 6 required you to write a Month class that holds information about the month. Write exception classes for the following error conditions:
A number less than 1 or greater than 12 is given for the month number.
An invalid string is given for the name of the month.
Modify the month class so it throws the appropriate exceptions when when either of these errors occurs. Demonstrate the classes in a program.
