PayrollClassExceptions
Programming challenge 5 of chapter 3 required you to write a Payroll class that calculates
an employee’s payroll. Write exception classes for the following error conditions:

1) An empty string is given for the employee’s name.

2) An invalid value is given for the employee’s ID number. If you implemented this field as a String,
then an empty string would be invalid. If you implemented this field as a numeric variable, then a
negative number or zero would be invalid.

3) An invalid number is given for the number of hours worked. This would be a negative number or
a number greater than 84.

4) An invalid number is given for the hourly pay rate. This would be a negative number  or a number
greater than 25.

Modify the Payroll class so it throws the appropriate exception when any of these errors occurs.
Demonstrate the exception classes in  a program.
