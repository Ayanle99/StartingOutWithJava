Exception Project

This assignment assumes you have completed Programming Challenge 1 of  Chapter 9 (Employee and ProductionWorker classes). Modify the Employee and ProductionWorker classes so they throw exceptions when the following errors occur.

1) The Employee class should throw an exception named InvalidEmployeeNumber when it receives an employee number that is less than 0 or greater than 9999.
2) The ProductionWorker class should throw an exception named  Invalid Shift when it receives  an  invalid shift.
3) The ProductionWorker class should throw an exception named InvalidPayRate when  it receives a negative number for the hourly pay rate.

Write a test program that demonstrates how each of these exception condition work.
