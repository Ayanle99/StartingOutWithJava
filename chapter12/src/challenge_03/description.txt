A university has the following dormitories:

Allen Hall: $1,500 per semester
Pike Hall: $1,600 per semester
Farthing Hall: $1,200 per semester
University Suites: $1,800 per semester

The university also offers the following meet plans:

	7 meals per week: $560 per semester
	14 meals per week: $1,095 per semester
	Unlimited meals: $1,500 per semester

Create an application with two combo boxes. One should hold the names of the dormitories,
and the other should hold the meal plans. The user should select a dormitory and a meal
plan, and the application should show the total charges for the semester.
