Create a GUI application  that simulates a game of tic-tac-toe. Figure 12-34 shown an example of the applicationâ€™s window.
The window shown in the figure uses nine large Label components to display the Xs and Os.

One approach in designing this application is to use  a two-dimensional  int array to simulate  the game board in memory.
When the user clicks the New Game button , the application should step through the array, storing a random number in the range of 0 through 1 in each element.
The number 0 represent the letter  O, and the number 1 represents the letter X.
The Label components should then be updated to display the game board. The application should display a message indicating whether player X won, player Y  won, or the game was a tie.
