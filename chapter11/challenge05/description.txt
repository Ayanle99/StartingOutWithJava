A movie theater only keeps a percentage of the revenue earned from ticket sales. The remainder goes to the movie company. Create a GUI application that allows the user to enter the following data into text fields:

1) Price per adult ticket
2) Number of adult ticket sold
3) Price per child ticket
4) Number of child tickets sold

The application  should calculate and display the following data for one night box office business at a theater:

1) Gross revenue for adult tickets sold. This is the amount of money taken in for all adult tickets sold.
2) Net revenue for adult tickets sold. This is the amount of money from adult ticket sales left over after the payment to the movie company has been deducted.

3) Gross revenue for child tickets  sold. This is the amount of money taken in for all child tickets sold.
4) Net revenue for child tickets sold. This is the amount of money from child ticket sales left over after the payment to the movie company has been deducted.

5) Total gross revenue. This is the sum of gross revenue for adult and child tickets sold.
6) Total net revenue. This is the sum of net revenue for adult and child tickets sold.


Assume the theater keeps 20% of its box office receipts Use a constant in your code to represent this percentage.
