A county collects property taxes on the assessment value of property, which is 60% of  the propertyâ€™s actual value.
If an acre of land is valued at $10,000, its assessment value is $6,000. The property tax is then $0.64 foreach
$100 of the assessment value. The tax for the acre assesed at $6,000 will be $38.50. Create a GUI application t
hat displays the assessment value and property tax when a user enters the actual value of a property.
