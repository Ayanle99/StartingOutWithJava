A retail company must file a monthly sales tax report listing the total sales for the month,
and the amount of state and county sales tax collected. The state sales tax rate is 4% and
the county sales tax rate is 2%. Create a GUI application that allows the user to enter
the total sales for the month into a text field. From this figure, the application should
calculate and display the following:

1) The amount of county sales tax
2) The amount of state sales tax
3) The total sales tax (county plus state)

In the applicationâ€™s code, represent the county tax rate (0.02) and the state tax rate (0.04( as named constants.
